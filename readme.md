CSS Type Selectors for JSON

Built with Jackson

Assume the first argument to the program is the JSON File Path

Program processes Json into an in memory tree from the file. 

The program converts the users input into a SearchNode object. The SearchNode object acts as a comparator, checking to see if any arbitrary node is equal to itself. Then a recursive depth first search of the tree is done.

If we were to implement Compound or Chained selectors we would return an array of two SearchNode objects. Then when traversing the tree if the first searchNode matched, we would scan all child nodes with our second SearchNode and upon a double match, return true. 

At this point, we could pass any arbitrary number of selectors using the same logic for a full solution.
